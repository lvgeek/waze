Fork from sashakh/wase
This is my attempt to make Waze run on Raspbian for use in Carpc
Hardware based on original design found at http://www.engineering-diy.blogspot.ro/
I want Waze instead of Navit

After installing build dependencies listed below, Waze compiled and ran on Pi.
Problems:
1 Cannot find GPSd on Pi
2 GTK display is distorted on Pi screen (lloks fine on Ubuntu 14 with ssh -X)


This is initial backport of Waze (http://www.waze.com) to Linux.

To install:

1. Build as regular user:

    $ make

(Some build dependencies may be needed. For examle for Ubuntu it is:
 - libsqlite3-dev
 - libgtk2.0-dev
 - libagg-dev
 - libfribidi-dev
)

2. Install some resource files in user's home directory:

    make install-user

, default installation directory is ~/.waze .

Note that this step is needed per each user which is supposed to use waze.

2. Install waze binary shared resources as root:

    make install

, default installation of waze binary is '/usr/local/bin/waze', installation
path for resource directory is '/usr/local/share/waze' (both is changeable
using PREFIX variable).

To run:

    $ waze

Enjoy!
